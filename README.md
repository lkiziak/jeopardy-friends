##Our Approach as a Team
This was a team project. Tasks were assigned according to what each member was comfortable with. We also allowed room for flexibility and learning opportunities. We communicated continously and allowed room for mistakes. We also provided support to one another when necessary. 

Allowing room for change really helped our project come together. We stayed on task and met our deadlines. We feel very good about our team-work and accomplishments.

We used a classic Jeopardy aesthetic. Our in-house designer used the classic Jeopardy blue and yellow to mockup some great looking wireframes that were followed. We used pictures of Alex Trebek to bring the user an authentic experience.
